VP-POC Screener
================
Signal screener based on the "Bar Magnified Volume Profile / Fixed Range"
concept (ChartPrime, TradingView): builds a fixed-range volume profile over
a lookback window, finds the highest-volume nodes (POC + HVN zones), and
raises LONG/SHORT signals when price wicks into one of those zones and
closes back out (a rejection / bounce off a high-volume support or
resistance area).

Runs as a local HTTP server (Flask) served through a mobile browser —
no exchange keys required, this build is signal/alert only (no
auto-trading). Data source: Gate.io USDT-M futures public REST API.

CHANGELOG
---------
v0.1.0 - initial release: contract universe fetch, fixed-range volume
         profile computation (bar-level proportional overlap, mirrors
         the Pine Script "quadratic" bin-attribution logic), HVN/POC
         zone extraction, bounce-signal detection, watchlist +
         signals API, canvas-based chart UI, optional Telegram alerts.
v0.1.1 - fix: universe builder was reading volume fields off
         /futures/usdt/contracts, which doesn't carry volume data at
         all (always 0 -> everything filtered out -> "0 пар"). Switched
         to /futures/usdt/tickers, which actually has volume_24h_quote/
         _settle/_base.
v0.1.2 - added explicit TP/SL per signal (stop beyond the far edge of
         the HVN zone, target at RR multiples of that risk, RR
         configurable via VP_RR) and outcome tracking: each scan cycle
         checks open signals' candles for TP/SL hits (or a timeout),
         closes them WIN/LOSS/TIMEOUT, and exposes rolling win-rate
         stats in /api/status and the UI header.
v0.2.0 - chart modal now draws entry/SL/TP lines for a clicked signal
         and highlights the POC zone (bold line + label, like the
         reference ChartPrime indicator); added a per-symbol parameter
         optimizer (walk-forward backtest over a small grid of
         lookback/HVN-count/RR) triggered on demand via an
         "Оптимизировать" button — picks the historically best-winrate
         combo for that symbol and uses it for that symbol's live
         signals going forward (/api/optimize/<symbol>).
v0.2.1 - added a data-quality gate: symbols whose candle feed itself
         looks illiquid/stale (too many zero-volume bars, too many
         flat high==low bars, or near-zero average range vs price —
         the "dashes that don't move" look on thin contracts) are
         excluded from the watchlist/signals even if they cleared the
         24h-volume filter. Excluded count shown in the header.
v0.3.0 - added MFE/MAE tracking (max favorable/adverse excursion, in R
         multiples of risk) per signal, kept updating for VP_MFE_TRACK_SEC
         after detection regardless of whether/when TP or SL fired —
         the raw data needed to later judge whether TP/SL should sit
         further out or tighter in. New "Тюнинг" tab aggregates
         avg/median/p25/p75 of MFE and MAE across WIN/LOSS/OPEN signals;
         new /api/tuning endpoint exposes the same numbers.
v0.3.1 - fix: update_signal_outcomes was checking the trigger candle
         itself (time >= sig["time"]) against SL/TP. That candle's own
         wick is what produced the signal (it's what touched the HVN
         zone) — checking it against SL/TP could close a trade
         instantly, on the very bar it was detected, before the trade
         had any chance to actually play out. Now only candles that
         close strictly AFTER the trigger bar (time > sig["time"])
         count toward TP/SL/MFE/MAE. This was corrupting the win-rate
         stats; in-memory stats reset on restart so this takes effect
         cleanly.
v0.4.0 - zone quality overhaul: extract_hvn_zones now drops merged
         zones taller than VP_MAX_ZONE_HEIGHT_FRAC of the whole profile
         range (no more wide/diffuse "zones"); added eligible_zones(),
         which restricts signal generation to zones whose volume is at
         least VP_ZONE_STRENGTH_MIN_RATIO of the POC's volume — weak
         zones still render on the chart (dim/dotted) but won't fire
         signals on their own. Added a second signal type, detect_breakout
         (price bases inside/around a zone for a few bars then clears an
         edge decisively) alongside the existing bounce/rejection
         detector — both run every scan, tagged via a new "reason" field
         (bounce/breakout) shown in the signals table and Telegram
         alerts. The per-symbol optimizer (backtest_params) now uses the
         exact same eligible-zone + bounce-or-breakout logic as live
         scanning, so tuned parameters stay consistent with what
         actually trades. Chart now visually distinguishes POC (bold
         green) / eligible zones (dashed amber) / weak context-only
         zones (faint dotted grey).
v0.4.1 - two fixes from live examples: (1) added a whole-profile
         "peakedness" gate in extract_hvn_zones — if the busiest bin
         isn't at least VP_MIN_PEAK_RATIO times the average bin, volume
         is just spread flat across the range and there's no real POC;
         such symbols now return zero zones instead of pretending the
         busiest bin means something. (2) the SL buffer (fraction of
         zone height beyond the edge) was a fixed global constant the
         optimizer never touched, so a symbol whose price routinely
         pokes slightly past a node before reversing would get stopped
         out even with "optimized" params. buffer_pct is now a 4th grid
         dimension (15% / 35%) in the per-symbol optimizer, so a wider
         stop can be selected per-symbol when it improves win rate.
v0.5.0 - defaults updated from the first real MFE/MAE dataset (159
         signals, 46% winrate): WIN median MFE was ~2.8R against a
         1.5R TP (leaving profit on the table), and LOSS median MFE
         was ~1.7R (a chunk of stopped-out trades kept moving the
         "right" way afterward — SL was clipped too close by noise).
         Raised default RR 1.5 -> 2.0 and default ZONE_BUFFER_PCT
         0.15 -> 0.30. Also widened the per-symbol optimizer grid to
         match (RR now tests 1.5/2.0/2.5, buffer now tests
         0.20/0.35/0.50) so "Оптимизировать" explores the same wider
         range instead of being capped below the new defaults.
v0.6.0 - added background auto-tuning: previously per-symbol
         optimization only ran when someone tapped "Оптимизировать" in
         the chart modal — every other symbol traded on global
         defaults forever. Each scan cycle now also (re-)tunes up to
         VP_AUTO_TUNE_PER_CYCLE (default 1) symbols, prioritizing ones
         with no override yet, then whichever override is oldest once
         VP_AUTO_TUNE_REFRESH_SEC (default 48h) has passed — so the
         whole universe gets tuned, and re-tuned, over time without any
         manual action. Kept deliberately slow (one symbol's 81-combo
         backtest costs real CPU) so it doesn't blow out the scan
         cadence on a phone; toggle via VP_AUTO_TUNE=0 to disable. The
         manual button still works for forcing an immediate re-tune.
         Header now shows tuning progress (N/universe already tuned).
